This repo is a place for me to work on Knight Lab Python projects found [here](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/).

The goal is for me to work through them and then be able to teach them later on.

The scripts here are not necessarily the correct way to go about solving the challenges. I'm no expert and do not claim to know the best solutions.
