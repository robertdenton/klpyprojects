You wake up in a room you've never been in before. This is a door behind you but it's locked and you need a key to open it. To your right, there is a blank wall. Directly in front of you there is a closed, unlocked door. To your left there is a dark hallway. How would you like to proceed?

---

You open the door and this room is very dark. You cannot see anything. Suddenly, a scantly clad young woman swings in like a wrecking ball, busting the walls down, and you retreat to the room with the locked door.

---

You enter the dark hallway. Suits of armor line the walls and you notice dog treats scattered on the floor. There are three doors along the hallway and one at the end. The first door is labeled "Laboratory". The second door is labeled "Saloon". The third is labeled "Factory". The door at the end of the hallway is labeled "Gardener's office" Which door would you like to try? One, two, three or office?

---

You slowly enter the Laboratory and make your way down the stairs. You encounter a humpbacked man named Igor who ignores you. You realize that this is Dr. Frankenstein's lab. You see him working over a table. You walk over and ask if he is, in fact, Dr. Frankenstein. He says hello and politely informs you that it's pronounced Frankensteen. You ask if he has a key to the front door and he says that he does not. You return to the hallway.

---

You slowly enter the Saloon and witness a vaudeville brawl in full swing. You see a man, unaffected by the mayhem sitting at the bar so you sit down next to him. He introduces himself: "My name is Jim, most people call me... Jim." You notice that his holsters are empty as he finishes a bottle of whiskey. You ask him if he has a key to the front door and he says that he left all he had in Waco. You return to the hallway.

---

You slowly enter the Factory and see a man wearing a purple suit and top hat, hobbling around with a cane. He is not very old but wears scorn on his face. He notices you and moves toward you with a heavy limp. As he approaches, he removes his top hat. Suddenly his can sticks into the ground but he continues for another step, before barrel rolling, popping up and welcoming you to his chocolate factory. You ask if he has a keep to the front door and he replies: "I'm sorry, all questions must be submitted in writing". You return to the hallway.

--- 

You slowly enter the Gardener's office just in time to witness a group of teenagers and a dog pull the mask off of a man pretending to be a monster. "Jinkies," one of the girls says. "It was the gardner the whole time!" The gardner replies: "And I would've gotten away with it to if it weren't for you meddling kids and that dog." On the table you notice the key so you grab it and show yourself out of the room.

---

You make it back to the locked door, use the key and open up the door. Suddenly you wake up in a cold sweat and realize you shouldn't watch movies before bed.

Thanks for playing!
